This algorithm is from the paper "How To Construct Polar Code", is construction of polar code by upgrading and degrading channels. 
I have implemented the algorithm with C++. It can be used with the frame length more than 1Mb. Meanwhile, the implementation supports to calculate the final value with multiple processes so as to save the calculation time. 
The code have several instructions:
-N: the block length is $n=2^N$
-mil: $\mu$ 
-p: the error bits rate is p*0.01
The output file contians two columns: the indexes of each channel and the estimated probability of error under maximum-likelihood decision.
